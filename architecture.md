## `Algebra-and-Geometry/`

It is the project's root folder, where the linear algebra libraries folder, the geometry files folder, the style sheets folder and finally the folder where the files that control the front and back-end are located. The project libraries were all developed using the OOP paradigm, as it is much better to work and manipulate the data.

### `algebra-libraries/`

This folder is where the linear algebra libraries are located. The `.js` files that are in this folder are:

- `linalg.js`: This library is where the calculation methods between matrices and vectors are.
- `matrix.js`: This library is responsible for creating arrays of different sizes.
- `vector.js`: This one is responsible for the vectors and it inherits the structure of the `matrix.js` library.
- `transformations.js`: This is a matrix and vector transformation library. It is heavily used in the `shapes2d.js` and `shapes3d.js` libraries to move geometric objects.
